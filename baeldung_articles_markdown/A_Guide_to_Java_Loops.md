# A Guide to Java Loops

## **1\. Overview**

In this article, we’ll look at a core aspect of the Java language – executing a statement or a group of statements repeatedly – using loops.

## **2\. Intro to Loops**

In programming languages, **looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling _Boolean-expression_ evaluates to _false_** _._

Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

Here are the types of loops that we can find in Java:

  * Simple _for_ loop
  * Enhanced _for-each_ loop
  * _While_ loop
  * _Do-While_ loop



## **3._For_ Loop**

A _for_ loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: [Java For Loop](/java-for-loop).

## **4._While_ Loop**

The _while_ loop is Java’s most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements _while_ its controlling _Boolean-expression_ is true.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: [Java While Loop](/java-while-loop).

## **5._Do-While_ Loop**

The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

For a detailed example, have a look at the dedicated post: [Java Do-While Loop](/java-do-while-loop).

## **6\. Conclusion**

In this quick tutorial, we showed the different types of loops that are available in the Java programming language.

We also saw how each loop serves a particular purpose given a suitable use case. We discussed the circumstances that are suitable for a given loop implementation.
